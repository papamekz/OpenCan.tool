# OpenCan.tool
OpenCan.tool: a laser-cut tool that marks empty spray cans as recyclable. Problem: media and waste firms often label cans dumped in public as hazardous, though theyâ€™re usually empty and count as metal packaging (code 15 01 04). Worst-case risk claims stigmatize graffiti culture and hinder free creative spaces.
