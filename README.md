# OpenCan.tool

A small laser-cut tool to help clearly declare **empty** spray cans as recyclable metal packaging (EWC 15 01 04).

## Why

Public reports and some waste operators often label dumped cans as "hazardous." In reality, **completely emptied** aerosol cans are metal packaging and belong in household recycling systems (EU). See: https://www.aerosol.org/regulatory-policy-affairs/environment/recycling/

> **Key point:** Empty cans ≠ hazardous waste. Classification: EWC 15 01 04 (metal packaging). Local municipal rules may vary.

Media and waste management companies often classify illegally disposed spray cans in public spaces as hazardous waste - even though they are predominantly empty. Risk assessments follow worst-case scenarios, leading to the demonization of illegal waste and UrbanArt culture, often hindering the installation of free creative spaces.

Spray cans already carry recycling symbols - the disposal costs have been paid at the time of purchase and are covered by these recycling systems (EU). Municipal companies may set different rules and usually own the few existing hazardous waste processing facilities for spray cans you have to pay extra for.

## What it does (and doesn't)

- ✔ Helps mark/document cans as **empty metal packaging** during clean-ups.
- ✔ Provides a consistent, physical aid for community sorting and reporting.
- ✖ Does **not** depressurize cans.
- ✖ Not for puncturing, venting or modifying pressurized containers.

- `Gefahrzeichen.OpenCan.info.png` – hazard symbols reference

## Build

- **Material:** 2–3 mm stainless steel or 3–4 mm aluminum (no brittle plastics)
- **Cutting:** standard laser/water-jet
- **Finish:** lightly deburr; optionally sharpen the tip at ~30–40°
- **Optional:** add a keyring hole if you like

## Use

1. Only handle cans that are obviously empty (no hiss, no weight, no propellant).
2. Use the tool to mark/report cans as "empty metal packaging" for recycling streams.
3. Follow local collection rules (yellow bin/bag or municipal recycling point).

## Safety

- Do not pierce or vent pressurized cans. If in doubt, treat as hazardous and stop.
- Wear gloves and eye protection during clean-ups.
- This is an **aid for classification and documentation**, not a pressure tool.

## Legal note

Waste codes and flows differ locally. Always follow your municipality's guidance. The EU packaging systems already cover disposal costs at purchase; municipalities can still impose process rules.

## Status

- v1.0 – initial release. Field-tested in community clean-ups; feedback welcome.
