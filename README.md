# OpenCan.tool

A laser-cut tool to help declare empty spray cans as recyclable waste.

## The Problem

Media and waste management companies often classify illegally disposed spray cans in public spaces as hazardous waste - even though they are predominantly empty spray cans that should be disposed of in household waste and are classified as metal packaging under Code 15 01 04. Risk assessments follow worst-case scenarios, leading to the demonization of illegal waste and Graffiticulture and often hindering the installation of free creative spaces.

**However:** Completely emptied cans are classified as metal packaging and can be disposed of in household waste or the yellow recycling bin. We refer to EU law: https://www.aerosol.org/regulatory-policy-affairs/environment/recycling/

Spray cans already carry recycling symbols - the disposal costs have been paid at the time of purchase and are covered by these recycling systems (EU).

Municipal companies may set different rules - they usually own the few existing hazardous waste processing facilities for spray cans you have to pay extra for. This laser-cut tool helps with clear declaration as empty metal packaging.

**Empty spray cans are not hazardous waste.**
